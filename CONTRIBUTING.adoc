=== Refactoring


==== Ask first

Please ask the maintainers before you refactor something non-trivial,
because refactorings (incl automatic refactorings via an IDE)
sometimes result in huge diffs,
which could take "forever" to code review.
Then it's better if the maintainers do the refactorings themselves instead
— this can save time for them and for you: Tell them what they should do,
and wait, and they'll get it done for you.


==== Moving code to new files

If you move methods or a class to a new file, then,
when the Talkyard project maintainers review the diff,
it'll look as if new code has been added,
and as if all lines would need to be carefully reviewed
— when in fact old code was just moved elsewhere.

_This could cause the maintainers to reject the contribution_,
until you've made it simpler to code review,
by instead making the changes like so:

1) Copy the whole file to the new file. Commit.
2) Delete things from the new file and old file.
   Maybe rename any class in the new file.
3) Commit again.

Now the maintainers will see a copy file commit,
and a delete-lots-of-code commit. Both of which are quick to review.
